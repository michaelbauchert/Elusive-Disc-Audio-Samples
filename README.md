# Elusive-Disc-Audio-Samples
A version of this webpage was created for internal use at [Elusive Disc](http://www.elusivedisc.com). It allows e-Commerce content creators to quickly convert full-length, uncompressed songs and recordings into 30 second mp3 files. Prior to this method, workers had to manually edit each file in a Digital Audio Workstation. This new web app saves hours of work time each week. 

These audio samples are made available to customers on product pages of ElusiveDisc.com via a web component called <elusive-sample>. This component greatly improves the process of adding audio samples to a products HTML description, and improves the customer's expirience on the site. Prior to the creation of this custom element, audio samples were only available as links that opened a new window containing the audio file.
